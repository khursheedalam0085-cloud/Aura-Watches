# Aura-Watches
Aura Watches is our e-project developed as part of coursework.  The project represents an online watch and clock showcase/store, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It focuses on clean UI design, product categorization, responsiveness, and practical implementation  of front-end web development concepts. Live demo is available via GitHub Pages.
